In scavenger hunt, at first, we trying to find everything in the list order, but we quickly realized is impossible. So, the library as a place all the group members known, we started searching ‚Äúa book containing Digital Media wisdom‚Äù. 

Then we found a book searching device and finds lots of book related to Digital Media wisdom.When we were walking out the library, we saw a vending machine in the corner. 

After this, we go downstairs and found the place for food, then we think we maybe can find ‚ÄúAn explosive cup of coffee‚Äù, but all the coffee stores are closes so we took a photo with coffee machine. 

Then we read the list again, the last thing sounds so abstractive, and we don‚Äôt know where to go, but luckily, before the time out, we saw the roots, the gate and the chair and took these photos.



## WEEK 01 Session 02

*Editing Practice*[^1]

[30 sec footage](https://vimeo.com/927841223?share=copy)

[Pre-task](https://vimeo.com/921993721?share=copy)

[Class sound task](https://vimeo.com/927872572?share=copy)

About this task, I think is a good try but still have a lot of space to improve. 
First, I realised I‚Äôm too focused on the logic between the footages instead of describing something emotional. Second, about the editing technique, I think still need to try more and have more practice.
So in the following task, I will more focus on the meaning editing gave to the footage not the own storyline of the footages.

... which can be written inline, like this: $\{ x, y, z \} \in \N$

... or block, like this:

$$ x^2 + y^2 = z^2 $$
